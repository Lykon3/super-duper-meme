# Collapse Engine Stack (JAX-Optimized + Bayesian Tensor Reweighting)

This engine models dynamic collapse and bifurcation in information-dense systems using JAX for GPU acceleration.
It includes:
- Manifold folding based on entropy/memory curvature
- Bayesian entanglement matrix updates
- Monte Carlo simulations of collapse zones
- Intervention zone detection

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run

```bash
python3 main.py
```

## Output
Generates `collapse_output_log.json` with prediction results and internal manifold state.
